# Census Data Analysis & Insights

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing census data to derive key demographic, economic, and social insights. It involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and visualizing population trends to support strategic decision-making.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`census13.csv`** - Raw census dataset containing demographic records.
- **`Census_Report.pdf`** - Detailed report covering the analysis methodology and insights.
- **`Data Science_Census_Data.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook containing the data processing workflow and visualizations.
- **`figures/`** - Directory containing generated visualizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Cleaning & Processing Techniques**
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualizations**

## 🔹 Key Features
### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handling missing and erroneous values.
- Standardizing formats for data consistency.
- Detecting anomalies in demographic attributes.

### **2. Census Insights & Analysis**
- **Population demographics**: Age distribution, gender ratios, marital status analysis.
- **Employment trends**: Occupation distribution, unemployment rates, workforce statistics.
- **Housing occupancy**: Identifying underutilized or overcrowded housing.
- **Commuter patterns**: Evaluating mobility trends and travel behavior.
- **Religious affiliations**: Analyzing religious distribution across age groups.
- **Economic insights**: Calculating birth, fertility, and death rates.

### **3. Data Visualization & Reporting**
- Population pyramids to illustrate demographic trends.
- Occupation and unemployment rate plots.
- House occupancy and commuter statistics.
- Marital status breakdown by gender and age.
- Income distribution and economic growth projections.

## 📊 Visualizations
This project includes a variety of charts and graphs to visually represent census data trends. All figures are saved in the `figures/` directory.
